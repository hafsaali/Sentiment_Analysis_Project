# Sentiment_Analysis_Project
A comprehensive machine learning project for classifying text sentiment into negative, neutral, and positive categories using advanced NLP techniques and multiple ML algorithms.

## Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning pipeline for sentiment analysis with the following key features:

Data Processing: Text cleaning, tokenization, and preprocessing
Feature Engineering: TF-IDF vectorization and n-gram analysis
Model Training: Multiple algorithms (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest)
Evaluation: Comprehensive performance metrics and visualizations
Deployment Ready: Easy-to-use prediction interface

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains 4 columns:

ID: Unique identifier for each text sample
text: The text content to analyze
label: Numeric labels (0: Negative, 1: Neutral, 2: Positive)
sentiment: String labels (negative, neutral, positive)
